README FOR INTERVIEW QUESTION (WORD-FREQUENCY)

The project contains two files:

a. "input.txt" is a plain ASCII text file containing the text of 'War and Peace' from the Gutenburg Project.
b. "stopwords.txt" is a text file containing one word per line; this is a list of words we want to exclude from the word frequency count.


YOUR TASKS:

1. Write code to read the file named, "input.txt" and produce a word-frequency count, excluding the words found in the "stopwords.txt" file.
2. Once you have counted the frequency of each word, display the 10 words that appear most often in the document, in descending order.


BONUS:

1. Consider how you might handle contractions as discrete words. For instance, "can't" might be broken into two words, "can" and "not".


IMPORTANT:

We don't expect a perfect solution. :) 

It's completely acceptable to have some unusually formatted words slip through; we are looking for an appropriate, reasonable attempt at developing a solution in a limited amount of time.

Your top ten list of words does not need to perfectly match the list of words found by our solution.

Write the code as though it were going into production; we want to see clean, easy to read code following good coding practices.

It is acceptable to hard-code the path to input files in your solution.

Add a small header comment at the top of your main file containing your name.
