# WordCount_2021
In 2021 I wrote this project to solve the classic problem of counting words in a text file. I was given the problem in an interview as a project to complete overnight.

## Prompt

The project contains two files:

a. "input.txt" is a plain ASCII text file containing the text of 'War and Peace' from the Gutenburg Project.
b. "stopwords.txt" is a text file containing one word per line; this is a list of words we want to exclude from the word frequency count.


YOUR TASKS:

1. Write code to read the file named, "input.txt" and produce a word-frequency count, excluding the words found in the "stopwords.txt" file.
2. Once you have counted the frequency of each word, display the 10 words that appear most often in the document, in descending order.


BONUS:

1. Consider how you might handle contractions as discrete words. For instance, "can't" might be broken into two words, "can" and "not".
